<p>

Long ago, a wicked and lazy hunter sat

under a tree. He was hungry, but did not

want to be bothered to find food. Below him

on the grassy field, there were robust

springbok grazing. Our friend, the hunter did

nothing, he only watched the animals as

they fed, wishing he could have meat

without working for it.

</p><p>

Suddenly he noticed the movement of a female cheetah seeking food. She

singled out a springbok who had foolishly wandered away from the rest.

Suddenly she gathered her long legs under her and sprang forward. With

great speed she came upon the springbok and brought it down. Startled,

the rest of the herd raced away as the cheetah attacked her prey.

</p><p>

The hunter watched as the cheetah dragged her prize to some shade on

the edge of the clearing. There, three beautiful cheetah cubs were waiting

for her. The lazy hunter was filled with envy for the cubs and wished that

he could have such a good hunter provide for him. Then he had a wicked

idea. He decided that he would steal one of the cheetah cubs and train it

to hunt for him. He decided to wait until the mother cheetah left the vicinity

to make his move. He smiled to himself, feeling like a genius.

Imagine dining on

delicious meat every

day without having to

do the actual hunting!

</p><p>

When the sun began to set, the cheetah hid her cubs in a bush and set off to the

waterhole. The hunter quickly grabbed his spear and trotted down to the bushes

where the cubs were hidden. There he found the three cubs, still too young to be

frightened of him or to run away. First, he chose one, then decided upon another,

and then changed his mind again. Finally he decided to steal all three cubs,

thinking to himself that he would do better to keep them all.

</p><p>

Mother cheetah

returned half-an-hour

later only to find her

cubs gone. She cried

until there were no

more tears in her eyes.

Day and night she

cried and searched for

her cubs. Until she met

an old man who came

to find out what the

problem was.

</p><p>

The old man was wise and

knew the ways of the animals.

When he heard what the wicked

hunter had done, he became

very angry. The lazy hunter was

not only a thief; he had broken

the traditions of the tribe.

Everyone knew that a hunter

must use only his own strength

and skill. Any other way of

hunting was surely a dishonour.

The old man returned to the

village and told the elders what

had happened. The villagers

became angry. They found the

lazy hunter and drove him away

from the village. The old man

took the three cheetah cubs

back to their grateful mother.
